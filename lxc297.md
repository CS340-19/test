# Explain the differences among github fork, git clone, and git branch

Github fork, git clone and branch are all used for different situations.  Github fork
is when you want to take a project's repository that someone else maintains, and spin
it off to be your own. This gives you full write access - something you did not
neccessarily have before. Git clone simply copies a repository to your computer,
which is the heart of git -- file revision management.  Git branch allows repository
maintainers to take a project "off to the sides", if you will.  The master branch is
where a project might always be stable, and a branch test allows the maintainers to
test new features whilst collaborating with other users.  Branches can then be merged
back to master once all bugs have been worked out.
