Explain the differences among github fork, git clone, and git branch.
----------------------------

Github Fork is used to take a directory from someone and create a copy on your own Github server.
Github Clone is used to take a directory from your Github server and create a copy on your local computer.
Github Branch is used to isolate development work without affecting other items in the repository. You can merge branches using a pull request.
