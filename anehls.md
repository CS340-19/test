Forking in Github creates a version of the repository that was forked on the users account, granting them write access to this particular version of that repository. They can then send a pull request to the owner of the original repository so that their changes can go there.

Cloning in Github creates a clone of the given repository on the users computer, allowing them to write code or add files that they couldn't do just with their github account. This is often used in conjunction with forking.

Branching in Github allows you to create seperate versions of a repository and work on them simultaneously, and then merge them at the end if necessary. This is different from forking in that both versions that exist have the same permissions, as opposed to forking which changes permissions such as write access.
