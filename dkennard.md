git fork allows the user to connect from an admin's repository into their own repository

git clone grabs the repository from GitHub and copies it to the user's local machine

git branch allows the user to diverge from the main development of a project to make
any desired changes, without messing with the previous versions of the
original project on the main timeline. Branching thus allows you to go back to the original state you branched from
if you feel as though the development you're doing in this branch is not right.
