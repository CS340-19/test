A GitHub fork is the copying of a repository, and allows you to edit and make changes to files without affecting the original project. A GitHub clone is utilized to create a local copy of a repository on your computer and allows the ability to sync between this location and the remote repository on GitHub. A GitHub branch creates an environment "where you can try new ideas". A branch will not be merged until it is ready to be shared with collaborators.
