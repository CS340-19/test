Github fork is used to import an existing project or branch from someone else's repository into your own github repository. This will create a copy of the repo on the server side, In order to start working on the repo, you use git clone on a local machine to make a workspace of your repo. 
git clone downloads the repo onto your machine and will link the local repo to the remote repo. 
git branch lets you create a copy of the repo whose changes will be tracked separately from the master branch.
