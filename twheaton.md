Differences between fork, clone, and branch

Fork: On the server side of git, it will copy a repository from someone else. 
This allows a large community of open source programmers to share source code
with one another.

Clone: Allows a user to copy a repository of thier choosing.

Branch: Branching allows you to work on different features you are trying to
implement without affecting the master branch. Each branch essentially points to
one of the commits you have made previously... in other words it points to the 
changes you made in the code previously.
