Fork   - This is when you copy a repo from one github account to another on the server side

Clone  - This makes a copy of a repo from the server side on your account to a local machine in your possession

Branch - This is for making it possible to take a project in a specific direction that you may or may not follow up on. 
		 Then you can make separate decision based changes that you may want to come back to reverse this porcess in case 
		 you decide you no longer want to continue to go down this path. If you decide it was a good way to go you can reintigrate it back into the project.
