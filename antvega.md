Github fork is when you create a copy of someone's repository to your own github account.

Git clone involves an address of a github repository. Performing a git clone on a local machine with the address copies the repository to the local machine.

Git branch creates a new pointer to the same commit you're currently on. It does not create an entire copy of the source tree, and it allows one to work safely without messing with the main line of development.
