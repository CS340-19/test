The Differences:

Forking is a copy of codes and programs that allows you can change them and do not affecting anything which is before you fork. And you can copy a repository to your GitHub repo from others GitHub repo. But these are only on the GitHub.

Clone is a copy of repository to your local pc so that you can edit them in local. Unlike forking, Clone is moviing codes or files from GitHub to your computer.

And Git Branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. All branches on GitHub will be copied in a fork.
