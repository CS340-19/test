A github fork is a way to make your own copy of a repo from another github
user's account to your github account.

The git clone command is another way of copying a repo but it copies a repo to
your local machine, not a github account.

The git branch command creates a pointer to a single commit, and is a way of
making your own seperate line of work that can later be merged back to the master branch.
