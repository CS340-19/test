git fork: This command allows a user to create a copy of an entire repository onto their github account. Any changes the user makes will not affect the original repository, unless they create a "pull request". This pull request may be denied by the owner of the original repository. Upon accepting a pull request, the copied repository is merged with the original.

git clone: Clone allows a user to make a local copy of a selected repositor. Changes may be merged into the repository by doing a "push".

git branch: Branches allow a developer to have multiple working environments from the same repository (assuming the branches don't conflict). Due to the fact that github stores your repository data as a series of "snapshots", the branches can allow one user to work on multiple (again, non-conflicting) versions of the repository without having to push before switching, by allowing the user to work on multiple snapshots.
