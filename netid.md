Github fork is when a user takes a repository from another
user and can modify files within it without changing
up the original user's files. It makes a copy of it under
a new user's account. 
Git clone takes a repository from a server and copies it
over to a local machine.
Git branch allows for a group to work on seperate implementations
without modifying the main branch's files. After implementations are
finished, group members can then merge additional branches into the
main branch (the master branch).
