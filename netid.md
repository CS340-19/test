Github's fork feature allows one user to copy a public repository to their account, and edit it as they wish, allowing for users to take public projects in new, separate directions.
This is a feature of Github, not git.

Git clone allows for a user to clone a repository from a git server onto your machine. It is a feature of git itself.

Git branch allows users to add new features to a stable project without sacrificing the project's current stability.
It allows you to change a copy of the repo to add your feature, delete the repo if the feature doesn't work out, or merge it in with the master branch if it does.
