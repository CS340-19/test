When you fork a repository on github, you copy it to your own github account. The fork exists on GitHub's server. You can then edit this copy without altering the original repository. If you want one of your changes to carry over to the original repo, you can make a pull request which the original project owner must then approve.

When you clone a repository, you create a local version of it on your computer. Since the clone is your personal copy, you can freely make changes without any required approval.

A branch is a way to organize changes within a repository. If you want to add a feature to a project, you can create a branch for it, then if you later want to remove all files related to that feature you can simply remove the branch.
